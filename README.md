## Introduction

Health and Rescue is a project aimed at providing a seamless experience for users to book ambulance rides quickly and efficiently. Users can log in, select their current location, choose the hospital they need to go to, and a nearby ambulance will be dispatched to pick them up and drop them off at the hospital without any hassle.

For drivers, they can register themselves and their vehicles. When a user requests an ambulance, nearby drivers will receive a notification on a map along with the user's location in real-time. The project utilizes various payment gateways such as EasyPaisa, JazzCash, Google Pay, etc., for smooth transactions. Additionally, it supports user authentication through Google and Facebook signup/login.
